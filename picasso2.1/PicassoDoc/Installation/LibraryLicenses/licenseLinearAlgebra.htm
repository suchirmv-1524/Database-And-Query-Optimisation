<p><strong>Example: Information Collected from the USDA Forest Service Website 
for Statistical Purposes</strong></p>
<p>Below is an example of the information collected based on a standard request 
for a World Wide Web document:</p>
<p>xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] &quot;GET /news/nr012797.html 
HTTP/1.0&quot; 200 16704 Mozilla 3.0/www.altavista.digital.com</p>
<p>xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)-- this is the host name (or IP address) 
associated with the requester (you as the visitor). In this case, (.com) the 
requester is coming from a commercial address. Depending on the requester&#39;s 
method of network connection, the host name (or IP address) may or may not 
identify a specific computer. Connections via many Internet Service Providers 
assign different IP addresses for each session, so the host name identifies only 
the ISP. The host name (or IP address) will identify a specific computer if that 
computer has a fixed IP address.</p>
<p>[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] -- this is the date and time of the request</p>
<p>&quot;GET /news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0&quot; -- this is the location of the requested 
file on the web server 200 -- this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request 
was filled</p>
<p>16704 -- this is the size of the requested file in bytes</p>
<p>Mozilla 3.0 -- this identifies the type of browser software used to access 
the page, which indicates what design parameters to use in constructing the 
pages</p>
<p>www.altavista.digital.com - this indicates the last site the person visited, 
which indicates how people find our site</p>
<p>Requests for other types of documents use similar information. No 
personally-identifying information is collected.</p>
